This quick article will be an intro to using the synchronized block in Java.Simply put, in a multi-threaded environment, a race condition occurs when two or more threads attempt to update mutable shared data at the same time. Java offers a mechanism to avoid race conditions by synchronizing thread access to shared data.A piece of logic marked with synchronized becomes a synchronized block, allowing only one thread to execute at any given time.
